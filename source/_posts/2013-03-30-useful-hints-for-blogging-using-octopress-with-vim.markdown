### 1. Dictionary ###

Use dictionary. I wrote about how to start it automatically for `markdown` files
[here](/blog/2013/03/19/another-blogger-switched-to-octopress).

* `z=` - probably most useful function for me right now, as you probably noticed 
  I'm not great in English, so if you see some glaring errors - let me know I 
  will fix it
