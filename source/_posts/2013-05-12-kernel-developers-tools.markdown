git, cscope, vi, bash, awk, and the rare bout with python.
Ubuntu with Unity2D
terminal, make, gcc, make me happy. Quilt for patch management, Git or 
Subversion for source code management. I'm using Nedit
SLED for work and openSUSE
email client (mutt), and my editor (vim),
git and quilt for kernel development, Chrome and Firefox for web browsing, and 
irssi for irc communication
NOME 3 on my desktop, but sometimes get frustrated with it and revert back to 
OpenBox or i3m
Xfce
fbcon, vim, and mutt
fvwm2
bash shell, joe editor, gcc, make, git
 Fedora
 Xfce
 git, sparse, smatch and spatch
 joe
  xterm, emacs, perl, mc and git.
  i3
  Emacs, ocaml, xfce
  Emacs, Evolution, GNOME 3, Iceweasel (aka Firefox)
