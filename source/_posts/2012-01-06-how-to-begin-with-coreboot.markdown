About a month ago I started my adventure with coreboot. As [coreboot home](http://www.coreboot.org/) page says "coreboot is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the proprietary BIOS (firmware) found in most computers". Although I read the majority of materials from mentioned page I still suffered from a lack of basic information that would help me to arrange everything in my head. Therefore, I decided to write a series of posts described my actions associated with this interesting project.  
    
    
At the beginning I would recommend some interesting sources of information on coreboot:  
    

- [http://www.coreboot.org/QEMU](http://www.coreboot.org/QEMU) - If you're impatient and want to start as soon as possible
- [Coreboot videos](http://www.coreboot.org/Screenshots#Videos) - One of the easiest ways to obtain general information about the project
- [Start to understand](http://lennartb.home.xs4all.nl/coreboot/coreboot.html) - I found this page by accident while googling materials, thanks to its author I understood basics and found out what's next
- [Documentation](http://www.coreboot.org/Documentation) - Many different types of documents, a large proportion of them are not applying to the latest version of coreboot v4, however, still has a educational value.

After reviewing the above materials, you should understand the basics of coreboot. In the [next post](http://pietrushnic.blogspot.com/2012/01/flashrom-and-shuttle-av18e2.html) I will describe [flashrom](http://flashrom.org/) application and my experience with one of the old motherboard.
