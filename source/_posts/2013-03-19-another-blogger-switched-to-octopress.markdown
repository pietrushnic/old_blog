description: Opinion about switching from blogger to octopress
---

It's been over 3 months when I published my last post. In chaos of daily jobs I 
realize that there is so much things that I don't like in Google Blogger that I 
have to find different solution for my blogging aspirations. So first of all 
requirements, what do I hate most in Blogger:

   * __editor__ - I used to vim and cannot stand that there is no bracket matching,
vertical/block modification, and other cool stuff that I use
   * __the way that page was stored__ - I want to have control on my blog and if I can 
use for example git to track its content that would be great
   *  __lamish__ - with Blogger I learned nothing, I look for something related with new 
trends in web development, it looks that ruby on rails is the most interesting 
framework

And I found [Octopress](http://octopress.org) it has all I need. The page states 
"A blogging framework for hackers". I don't know if I can or should call myself 
hacker but the idea is great for me.

So I start to move my blog to Octopress. Of course there is a plenty of things 
to do but also many to learn.
