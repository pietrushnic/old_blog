Another time-waster was a decent code formatter and syntax highlighter.Â I google out [following solution](http://www.commonitman.com/2010/09/how-to-use-syntax-highlighter-3-in.html), it is based on [SyntaxHighlighter 3](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) It has interesting options:  

1. You can select the language for which a syntax-colored
2. Turn on/off line numbering
3. Themes - this one is pretty nice for my blog
4. Customizable tabs size
5. The option to disable toolbar

My dream would be to create a theme that would look similar to vim syntax highlighing.
