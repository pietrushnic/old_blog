Blog has changed slightly. I've added two new sections: social media and afk. In "social media" I will add links to my profiles on various social networking sites. You'll find my most recent development achievements ( [@github](https://github.com/pietrushnic)) and twitts on topics of interest to me ( [@twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/pietrushnic)). The second section, "afk" (away from keyboard) is intended for the information of life beyond the keyboard, which in my case is not too extensive. I will publish here information about the books we read, watched movies and many other interesting things, which can be passionate away from the keyboard.
