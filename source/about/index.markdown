#### Who am I ? ####

I will answer like _well trained_ corporate worker: `Very good question!`
In this situation it means _hard question_.

I'm probably another linux enthusiast with extrovert tendencies who decide to
create own blog.

#### Why I write blog ? ####
This idea born when I realize that I have to repeat some things because my 
memory is not in 100% reliable. I decide to take notes. I always try to ask myself: 
_What I can do better ? What's the potential profit to cost ratio ?_ I realized
that if I take the notes than why not sharing this on-line get the feedback, build Internet 
profile, develop my skills and learn something new. At least we live to improve 
this world even if this is only elimination of inefficient parts of DNA code.


#### What interests me ? ####

* __freedom and liberty__ - everything related with freedom and liberty, some of below 
  points follow this trend :)
* __linux__ - I'm linux user not so long in comparison to people that I met 
  but idea of freedom is with me probably from the beginning. I use linux since 
  15th year of my life (then I got my first x86 computer). This story is long so I will 
  not torment you...
* __embedded__ - this hobby is not so old but related to linux, I think a lot 
about my career and embedded systems lay on one of possible paths. In this 
category falls _Android_ and my tries of creating apps.
* __web design__ - for blogging and application writing purposes so I learn 
  javascript, css, jQuery, Ruby and other related languages.
* __open movement__ - I'm also enthusiast of `open*` no matter if this is source 
  or hardware _Information wants to be free_
* __economics and politics__ - till I start professional work I was in some way 
  great ignorant in this matter, after I saw level of taxation on my monthly 
  payroll I was so pissed off that I have to learn why it happen. Since I 
  understand basics I'm austrian economy and libertarian enthusiast.
* __books__ -  trying to read as much as I can in my free time. I read not only 
technical stuff. I enjoy fantasy, sci-fi when I want to take break off from my daily 
routine. To get knowledge to satisfy my personal ambitions I read philosophy, 
economics and theology stuff.
* __music__ - What would my life be without music ? I'm fan of psychedelic 
  rock especially _Pink Floyd_, classic rock, progressive rock & metal, heavy metal (_Iron Maiden_, _Manowar_), trash (_Slayer_, 
  _Metallica_, _Megadeath_) and many others ... Another long story simply check my old [last.fm profile](http://www.lastfm.pl/user/cl4sh).
* __chess__ - I play chess since I was 7 (my grandfather learned me the basics).
This hobby was few times neglected but I always came back to it. I'm not a great 
player my rank is 1700 on [chess.com](http://chess.com). If you want to play 
with me just let me know. Your level doesn't matter.
* __bridge__ - I had often played cards not only bridge. I had poker episode and 
  other games that names I even don't know because their specific to Polish 
  language.
* __traveling__ - I'm beginner but I really like to travel and meet different 
  people, different cultures especially through prism of freedom.

#### Why this blog is in English ? ####
* writing in Polish I cannot target so big audience as in English
* English is the language of innovation/computers/technology and this blog is 
partially about that.
* I want to improve my English skills, which, as you can see, is not so 
  impressive.
