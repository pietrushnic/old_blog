    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I began this article last year. Until now I wonder if anyone could be interested
in reading about book that I read. I saw great interesting in linux/embedded
stuff but what about different things that we met every day. What about
politics/economics and religion ? Don&rsquo;t know if you should start this but I will
give it a try.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m argue a lot about politics/economics and religion. I don&rsquo;t have education in
this matter but study by myself a little bit. So maybe this is good place for
sharing ideas.</p>

<p>So about a year ago I read a book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Economics-Politics-Monarchy-Natural/dp/0765808684">&ldquo;Democracy: The God That Failed&rdquo;</a>.
I talk a lot about this book with mu colleagues and have to said that some ideas in it
are very controversial. One thing is that Hoppe assume some economic facts that
are not clear for most people &ndash; I agree with most of them, because it is
libertarian point of view and right now I&rsquo;m trying to follow this ideas of
freedom.</p>

<p>Hoppe shows that people democracy have to fail because leads to socialism.
Increasing number of privileges and promoting average citizen to politics cause
system inefficient. So most of this things in my environment are well known and
discussion goes to details.</p>

<p>Probably the most shocking for me was concept of totally private security system.
Everyone can have guns, missiles, tanks or any other fight equipment he want.
Hoppe is an anarcho-capitalist so he doesn&rsquo;t like state and it&rsquo;s monopoly on
high end weapon. After rethinking twice this concept could be good but IMO
through natural evolution we will get companies that would take care about
security. Also today we can find some trends in this, many Polish citizen with
high wages go to closed residential housing with security, protecting themselves
against poor, beggars and drunk junkies.</p>

<p>Second thing that heated debate was that state kills more than anarchy or not
organized society. Discussion goes to question: When more people were killed
during the Middle Ages, which took quite a long time, or in a few wars started
by democratically ruled countries ?</p>

<p>So if we look at wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_and_disasters_by_death_toll">article</a>
what we can see ? Biggest killers in history are Chinese and they did this in
medieval. So not Europe with it Christian crusade and small contention between
the principalities ? I will not count Mongolian and Tatar invasion because it took 200
years, so this was not a simple war it was series of wars simply concatenated in
one. Surprising data from China, they were able to kill 5-15% of world population
three times during medieval. They didn&rsquo;t have atomic bomb, Ebola, chemical poisons
and they did this. If you ever read something about China history you that it is
one of the best organized society in the world (take a look at great wall).
First administration exams, wheel base (width of road), language was standardized
over 2k years ago. Very good organization of the state. So biggest wars and most
killed battles came from well organized strong state. If you want peace you
don&rsquo;t need &ldquo;New World Order&rdquo; or &ldquo;World Government&rdquo; you need weak state with
power distributed to locally living people. Let them decide if they want
conflict with town or village near them. Or maybe better live in peace, trade
freely and make world better. Centralized systems are slow, inefficient and cost
a lot. Distributed systems are those in which life of one man is important.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>  <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Ludzkie_dzialanie_okladka.jpg/166px-Ludzkie_dzialanie_okladka.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&ldquo;Human Action&rdquo; Ludwig von Mises&rsquo;s work by some of called the pope of free market. IMHO is one of the best books on economics I read in my life. It is not easy, however, giving it time with certainly pays off. Allows to understand the basic laws which ruled the modern world of finance. Mises in a sensational way talk about the myths explaining what is inflation, why it has impact on our lives, what is and how works the supply of credit, and who depend most on the production of money without coverage (<em>fiat</em> money). I can say that until I read this book, I was lost in the dark. Thanks to it I received a weapon to overthrow ridiculous  world order concepts, absurd messages communicated in the media. I recommend:  <a href="http://mises.org/store/Human-Action-The-Scholars-Edition-P119.aspx">mises.org store &ndash; Human Action </a></p>
