<p>As I mentioned in previous <a href="http://pietrushnic.blogspot.com/2012/02/first-steps-to-improve-work.html">post</a> I work a lot on improving my productivity. After FreeMind it is time for <a href="http://darcs.nomeata.de/arbtt/doc/users_guide/">arbtt</a>. This is small tool which tracks active windows during your work. It is delivered with distro that I&#8217;m currently using (Debian wheezy). So all I had to do was:</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install arbtt Below I try describe how I configure arbtt to work with some apps that I use (Google Chrome, FreeMind, gnome-terminal and screen).<br/>
To effectively work with arbtt I had to run a daemon that collects information. In this way, I found the first problem, namely, it is hard to find a website, which correctly explains how to execute command during startup on Debian with GNOME environment. After few tries I realize that I should focus on GNOME autostart mechanism. This led me to create little file in $HOME/.config/autostart which looks like that:</p>

<p>[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Encoding=UTF-8 Name=The Automatic Rule-Base Time Tracker Exec=arbtt-capture Terminal=false So I had configured arbtt and it starts to capture data about my work. To display this data in friendly manner arbtt-stat should be used. Application complains if $HOME/.arbtt/categorize.cfg wasn&#8217;t configured for it appropriate. Detailed documentation about this file can be found on arbtt <a href="http://darcs.nomeata.de/arbtt/doc/users_guide/configuration.html">configuration page</a>. The process of writing this file should be iterative, starting point for me was:</p>

<p>&#8211; This defines some aliases, to make the reports look nicer: aliases ( &#8220;sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer&#8221; -> &#8220;java&#8221; ) &#8211; A rule that probably everybody wants. Being inactive for over a minute &#8211; causes this sample to be ignored by default. $idle > 60 ==> tag inactive, current window $program == &#8220;sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer&#8221; &amp;&amp; current window ($title =~ /(.+)\s-\sFreeMind/) ==> tag program:FreeMind-$1, current window $program == &#8220;gnome-terminal&#8221; &amp;&amp; current window ($title =~ /(.+)/) ==> tag term:$1, &#8211; Simple rule that just tags the current program tag program:$current.program, &#8211; I&#8217;d like to know what web pages in google-chrome I&#8217;m working in. So I do &#8211; not tag necessarily by the active window title, but the title that contains &#8211; the specific string. current window $program == &#8220;google-chrome&#8221; &amp;&amp; any window ($program == &#8220;google-chrome&#8221; &amp;&amp; $title =~ /(.+)\s-\sGoogle\sChrome/) ==> tag www:$1, However, after creating a configuration file such statistics were displayed correctly it was still a big problem to solve - how to combine arbtt with gnome-terminal and screen. The first one requires only a correctly set the window&#8217;s name. Although the synchronization of the terminal window&#8217;s name with a window inside the screen was not a trivial task (primarily on the mass of broken tutorials that can be found on the web). Finally my .screenrc looks like that:</p>

<p>termcapinfo xterm* &#8216;hs:ts=\E]0;:fs=\007:ds=\E]0;\007&#8217; defhstatus &#8220;[screen] ^Et&#8221; hardstatus off # Set the scrollback length: defscrollback 10000 # Select whether you want to see the copyright notice during startup: startup_message off # Display a caption string below, appearing like tabs and # displaying the window number and application name (by default). caption always caption string &#8220;%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{= kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B} %m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]&#8221; #&#8221;%{= kb}[ %=%{w}%?%-Lw%?%{b}(%{W}%n*%f %t%?(%u)%?%{b})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{b}][%{B} %H %{W}%l %{b}][%{B} %d.%m.%Y %{W}%0c %{b}]&#8221; #&#8221;%{bw}[%H] [%?%-Lw%?%{wb}%n*%f%t%{bw}%?%+Lw%?]%=%{bw} [%1`] [%c:%s] [%l]&#8221; # &#8220;%{kw}%-w%{wr}%n %t%{-}%+w&#8221; defhstatus set terminal title and caption keeps data about my open windows in screen. Every time I open new window or change current one terminal title is updated.<br/>
For now that&#8217;s all. In the future I wanted to write how to synchronize the title of the window in the screen with vim editor to include information about the currently edited file.</p>
