<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">The problem encountered on several occasions over several months. Now it is time to deal with it. How did this happen? As always, resources were not sufficient, and if we can not increase the amount of resources we must strive to optimize their use.In this case, it was about time.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">While reading my last&nbsp;acquisition, once again I faced the problem of re-configure Linux account.&nbsp;Every time&nbsp;when I need new account for some reasons I need to configure some things manually. Most things are simple enough, we copy&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">configuration files&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">from the already existing user directory, and voila. Of course Murphy's law works, and something goes wrong. Sometimes we need to create a new account with just a few of the tools configured as in other existing accounts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">So we have a problem, however, reflecting on the solution, my mind was deepened in the increasing number of new issues, which caused the solution became more distant.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">How this process looks like? First we need new account, it should get automatically some configuration&nbsp;files that I create for other accounts. Second I realize that I don't have methods for storing configs that I use most. I heard about dotfiles tracking with git with&nbsp;cloud help (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>). When I google this issue I found <a href="https://github.com/trym/dotty">dotty</a>. But after that I ask myself about productivity improvements in broad sense and the conclusion was that my work scheme should be&nbsp;changed. So I try to find some hints about improving productivity, there are&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;of web pages about that. Few things I found useful first of all the idea of "automated time tracking". Second that chaos that I produced during solving simple problem meant that I thought about controlling of its flow, and this led me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">mind mapping</a> technique. AFAIK <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">FreeMind</a>&nbsp;is the best free software for playing with this way of data presentation. Below I attach my first mind map in FreeMind, this is of&nbsp;course&nbsp;beta version.</span><br />
